# Mask RCNN (Object Detection) using `tensorflow`

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is mainly for image classification. While an R-CNN, with the R standing for region, is for object detection. ... It is actually possible to regress bounding boxes directly from a CNN but that can only happen for one object at a time.

You can now build a custom Mask RCNN model using [Tensorflow Object Detection Library!](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) Mask RCNN is an instance segmentation model that can identify pixel by pixel location of any object.

> Need tensorflow Version > 1.4, use  `pip install tensorflow==1.4.0`
